### Research that argues with itself.

Colony is a recursive peer-reviewed AI research platform. Not a chatbot. Not a search engine. A system of six named agents that autonomously explore a research goal, critique each other's findings, verify citations, and synthesize a final report grounded in real sources. Over time, it builds a persistent knowledge graph that compounds across sessions.

## The Core Idea

Every other AI tool answers questions. Colony explores domains.

Most AI research tools make one pass — query in, answer out. Colony runs an adversarial loop. A dedicated Critic agent stress-tests every finding before it reaches the Synthesizer. A Verifier checks whether cited sources actually say what they claim. The result is a conclusion that's been argued over, not just generated.

And unlike stateless chat tools, Colony remembers. Every run builds the Atlas — a persistent knowledge graph that compounds across sessions. A Colony that has researched a domain for weeks has mapped contradictions and built structured knowledge that doesn't exist anywhere else.

## The Six Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🌱 **Seeder** | Maps the research goal into 3–7 distinct exploration threads — not variations, genuinely different angles |
| 🔍 **Explorer** | Researches each thread using real web search and academic sources, injecting prior Atlas knowledge before each run |
| ⚖️ **Critic** | Peer-reviews every finding. Scores confidence 0–100, flags weak sources and logical gaps, sends the colony back in if evidence is insufficient |
| 🔬 **Verifier** | Fetches every cited URL and checks whether the source actually supports the claim. Flags dead links and hallucinated attributions |
| 🧬 **Synthesizer** | Reads the entire colony memory and writes a final report with a plain-language TL;DR and full layered analysis — flagging what's known, probable, and uncertain |
| 📁 **Memory** | Saves every verified finding to the Atlas. Every run makes future runs smarter |

The Explorer and Critic are the recursive core. Explorer finds, Critic tears apart, Explorer goes deeper. This adversarial loop is what separates Colony from single-pass research tools.

## Features

- **Recursive research loop** — configurable depth, adversarial by design
- **Real web search** — Brave Search API fires on every Explorer call
- **Academic sources** — Semantic Scholar integration for peer-reviewed papers
- **Citation verification** — Verifier fetches and validates every source
- **Persistent Atlas** — shared knowledge graph that compounds across all sessions
- **Private Codex** — personal research archive, saved and searchable
- **Shareable syntheses** — every completed run gets a public URL
- **Soul documents** — each agent has an identity document defining how it thinks, not just what it does
- **Dark academia aesthetic** — because research tools should feel serious
